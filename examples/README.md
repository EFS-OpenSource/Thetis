We have prepared several examples to demonstrate Thetisâ€™s capabilities and to help you get started with your own model data analysis. Depending on your use case, refer to the following examples:


## Detection task example

Learn how to use Thetis to evaluate image-based object detection models. This example uses a Faster R-CNN model from Torchvision to detect cars and pedestrians:

## Classification task example

Learn how to evaluate and rate your classifier AI model with a binary classification example from scikit-learn:
[classification.ipynb](https://github.com/EFS-OpenSource/Thetis/blob/main/examples/classification.ipynb)


## Regression task example

Learn how Thetis evaluates regression models. In this tutorial, we create a synthetic dataset and use a Bayesian Ridge Regression model provided by scikit-learn to predict a person's net worth based on observable features:
