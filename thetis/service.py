    """
    Main function for the Thetis evaluation toolkit. Given a ground truth dataset and the respective predictions
    by an AI model, this function examines various aspects such as performance, uncertainty consistency, fairness,
    and robustness. It supports tasks like classification, detection, and regression.

    Note: You must provide one of the following arguments for license validation: `license_file_path`,
    `license_xml_str`, or `license_key_and_signature`.

    Args:
        config: Application configuration options provided by the user.
        predictions: Predictions made by the AI model.
            **Classification:** DataFrame with columns "labels" and "confidence".
            **Detection:** Dict with DataFrame entries for each image, containing columns "labels", "confidence",
            and bounding box coordinates. The bounding box columns must correspond to the format specified in
            the user configuration.
            **Regression:** DataFrame with columns "predictions" and "stddev" (standard deviation).
        annotations: Ground truth data.
            **Classification:** DataFrame with columns "target" and optionally sensitive attributes.
            **Detection:** Dict with DataFrame entries for each image, containing columns "target", bounding box
            coordinates and optionally sensitive attributes. The bounding box columns must correspond to the format
            specified in the user configuration. Must also include a "__meta__" key with image metadata.
            **Regression:** DataFrame with columns "target" and optionally sensitive attributes.
        output_dir: Path to the output directory where the PDF report will be stored. Default is None.
        predictions_perturbations: AI predictions for each configured perturbation type.
        license_file_path: Path to an XML license file to run the application.
        license_xml_str: String representation of an XML license file to run the application.
        license_key_and_signature: Tuple of license key and signature strings.
        return_svg: boolean flag which enables/disables returning Matplotlib (SVG) figures. Default is False to filter
            out these figures as they cannot be serialized in plain JSON format. Set to True explicitly if
            you want to obtain the figures directly.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with the evaluation results, rating scores, and recommendations for the examined AI model.
