    """
    Main entrance point for the Thetis evaluation service. Given a ground-truth data set and the respective
    predictions by an AI model, this service examines several safety-relevant aspects such as uncertainty quality,
    data set quality, performance metrics, and fairness.

    Args:
        config: dict with application configuration options provided by the user.
        predictions: If task is "classification", pd.DataFrame representing the AI output on the ground-truth data
            set. Expected columns: "labels", "confidence", and bounding box information for object detection.
            if task is "detection", Dict with pandas DataFrames representing the predictions of an AI model for each
            image. The dict keys are the image identifiers.
            Expected fields in the dictionary: entries (pd.DataFrame) for each image with
            columns "confidence" and bounding box information according to the specified bounding box format.
        annotations: If task is "classification", pd.DataFrame representing the ground-truth data set.
            Expected columns: "target", sensitive feature, and bounding box information for object detection.
            If task is "detection", Dict with pandas DataFrames representing the ground-truth annotations for
            each image. The dict keys are the image identifiers.
            Expected fields in the dictionary: "__meta__" with data set meta information and
            entries (pd.DataFrame) for each image with columns "target" and bounding box information according
            to the specified bounding box format.
        output_dir: str with path to the output directory where the PDF report will be stored in.
            Set this to None (default) to disable PDF report creation.
        predictions_perturbations: Dict with AI predictions for each configured perturbation type.
            The perturbation type is the key of the dictionary, whereas each value must have the same format
            as the "predictions" parameter.
        license_file_path: os.PathLike pointing to an XML license file to run the application.
            Either 'license_file_path', 'license_xml_str', or 'license_key_and_signature' must be given.
        license_xml_str: str with already read string representing the content of an XML license file to run the
            application. Either 'license_file_path', 'license_xml_str', or 'license_key_and_signature' must be given.
        license_key_and_signature: Tuple of two strings with already read license key and license signature as strings.
            Either 'license_file_path', 'license_xml_str', or 'license_key_and_signature' must be given.
        return_svg: boolean flag which enables/disables returning Matplotlib (SVG) figures. Default is False to filter
            out these figures as they cannot be serialized in plain JSON format. Set to True explicitly if
            you want to obtain the figures directly.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with the evaluation results, rating scores, and recommendations for the examined AI model.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if neither 'license_file_path', 'license_xml_str', 'license_key_and_signature', THETIS_LICENSE,
